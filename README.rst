**NOTE: This project is no longer developed and has been archived.**

Description
-----------
gshogi is a program to play Shogi (Japanese Chess). It has a builtin
engine and can also use USI engines. It is written in python3 and C and runs
on GTK3 (PyGI) desktops.

It's licensed under the GPL v3+ (see the file named LICENSE).

It uses python for the gui and C for the engine code.

See the project homepage for more information on gshogi and USI engines.

Linux Installation
------------------
**Prerequisites**

You need to install these prerequisites first:

    * python
    * python-cairo
    * python-gobject

You need the python3 versions.
These will have different names depending on your Linux.
    
On Debian/Mint/Ubuntu
    * python3-gi-cairo
    * gir1.2-rsvg-2.0

On Fedora
    * python3-cairo
    * python3-gobject

On Arch
    * python-cairo
    * python-gobject

**Install gshogi**

Installing from source
  
  Use this method if you are using the latest development version from github.

  Install gcc, python3-devel in addition to the above prerequisites.

  |  Then enter *'python3 setup.py build'* to build it.

  |  Then *'python3 run.py'* to run it from within the source folder.

  You can also install it on the system.

  To do this enter *'python setup.py install'* (as root user).

  Note if installing on the system:

      gshogi should now be installed on your system. You can launch it from
      the gnome menu (under games) or type 'gshogi' in any terminal window.

      There is no uninstall (setuptools doesn't have one). If you need to
      uninstall you have to make a note of the file names and then delete
      them manually.

      If running the build/install multiple times it's best to delete the
      build folder each time.

Installing from the Python Package Index with pip

  If you want to install the last release you can install wheels from PyPI using pip.  

    pip3 install gshogi

  Or install it into a virtual env:

    |  python3 -m venv --system-site-packages testvenv
    |  source testvenv/bin/activate
    |  pip install gshogi

  Note you still need to install the python-gobject and python-cairo prerequisites listed above.

Windows Installation
--------------------
The best method for windows is to use the all in one installer from the project website.

You can also use pip to install it but you will need to install pygobject for windows
first.

You can also build it yourself (see the file Readme-windows.txt).


Usage
-----
You play black (the pieces at the bottom of the board). The computer plays
white (the pieces at the top of the board). Press the green go button to
start the clock. To move a piece click on it and then click on the square
you want to move it to (or drag it and drop it).

Also you can play one engine against another which is good for comparing
USI engines.

**Adding a USI engine**

To add a USI engine to play against click on Options, engines then click
the 'Add' button to add a new engine. Navigate to the engine executable
and add it. Then click the OK button.

If the USI engine has parameters (eg. *'java -jar enginename'* or *'enginename -usi'*)
then you can set up a shell script (or bat file in windows) to start the engine and
then add the shell script in gshogi. 

**command line options**

You can specify some options on the command line.

If you want to see the USI commands then start it from a terminal with:

    gshogi -vusi     (or ./run.py -vusi if not installed)

For full debugging output use the command:

    gshogi -v    (or ./run.py -v if not installed)

You can specify a game file to open:

    gshogi /path/to/gamefile.psn
    
Use -m to show moves and comments in the main window:

    gshogi -m /path/to/gamefile.psn
 
Use -h to show header of loaded files:

    gshogi -h /path/to/gamefile.psn
    
Use -mh to show both:    
    
    gshogi -mh /path/to/gamefile.psn

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi for the rules of Shogi.

File Support
------------
You can load/save games in PSN format or in gshog format.
It is recommended to use PSN format.

gshogi can also read multi-game PSN files.

Edit Board Function
-------------------
When edting the board position you can increase the count of a piece in
the komadai by right-clicking on it. Left-click on it to decrease the
count.

To add a white piece to the main board right-click on the square you
want to add the piece to then select the piece from the pop-up menu.
To add a black piece left-click on the square.


Time control/Level support
--------------------------
Examples of time controls that can be used with gshogi.

These were tested with the gse 0.1.4 engine.
Note that not all USI engines will work with all time controls.
Most engines work OK with byoyomi so use that if you have problems.

Note that times on the go command are in milliseconds.

byoyomi

    e.g. 60 minutes game time plus 30 seconds byoyomi
    This means the player can make as many or as few moves as they like
    in the 30 minutes and after that they will have 30 seconds per move.

    go btime 3600000 wtime 3600000 byoyomi 30000

    If you want a fixed time of 10 seconds per move:
    go btime 0 wtime 0 byoyomi 10000

    see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byoyomi

classical

    e.g. 5 moves in 10 minutes

    go btime 300000 wtime 300000 movestogo 40

Incremental

    e.g. 30 minutes game time and 10 seconds bonus time per move
    This means the basic time for the game is 30 minutes and after
    each move a bonus of 10 seconds is added to the clock.

    go btime 1800000 wtime 1800000 binc 10000 winc 10000

Fixed Time Per Move

    e.g. 20 seconds per move
    go movetime 20000

Fixed Search Depth

    e.g. Terminate the search when a depth of 8 is reached.

    go depth 8

Infinite search

    The search will go on indefinitely and will only terminate if
    a stop command (move now) is sent from the gui.

    go infinite

Fixed No. of Nodes

    The search will terminate after a fixed no. of nodes has been searched.

    go nodes 10000000


Note that byoyomi is not part of the original USI specification
(See http://www.glaurungchess.com/shogi/usi.html) but it is
supported in most USI engines.


Custom Pieces
-------------
You can load custom pieces using the 'Load Custom Pieces' button on the
'set pieces' menu.

To set up your own custom pieces you must provide images with these filenames.
You can use either png or svg files. If you use png change the file extension
from svg to png.

    Black Pieces:

        =======================   ============
        Piece                     Filename
        =======================   ============
        King                      kingB.svg
        Rook                      rookB.svg
        Bishop                    bishopB.svg
        Gold General              goldB.svg
        Silver General            silverB.svg
        Knight                    knightB.svg
        Lance                     lanceB.svg
        Pawn                      pawnB.svg
        Promoted Rook             rookPB.svg
        Promoted Bishop           bishopPB.svg
        Promoted Silver General   silverPB.svg
        Promoted Knight           knightPB.svg
        Promoted Lance            lancePB.svg
        Promoted Pawn             pawnPB.svg
        =======================   ============

The black piece images are mandatory. You can optionally provide images
for the white pieces as well. If you provide white piece images gshogi
will use them. If you don't it will use the black piece images and
rotate them through 180 degress.

    White Pieces:

        =======================   ============
        Piece                     Filename
        =======================   ============
        King                      kingW.svg
        Rook                      rookW.svg
        Bishop                    bishopW.svg
        Gold General              goldW.svg
        Silver General            silverW.svg
        Knight                    knightW.svg
        Lance                     lanceW.svg
        Pawn                      pawnW.svg
        Promoted Rook             rookPW.svg
        Promoted Bishop           bishopPW.svg
        Promoted Silver General   silverPW.svg
        Promoted Knight           knightPW.svg
